- cantata.dsl namespace?
	- select, where, etc
	- belongs-to, has-one, has-many
- tests for recursive rels
- allow saving has-one rels?
- postgres array support
	- reify java.sql.Array?
	- see http://tech.valgog.com/2009/02/passing-arrays-to-postgresql-database.html
- subquery in :from? https://gist.github.com/3984333
- export/import :bytes data
	- #base64 reader tag (should add namespace?)
	- wrap in container type, define print-method for that
	- crib from https://github.com/hiredman/bytes/blob/master/src/com/thelastcitadel/bytes.clj
	- can use staff picture from original sakila data to test
- allow ad-hoc entities in join, include, etc
	- must add them to qenv
- custom :on rel clause
- java logging
	- trace logging
- ::query-cache ds key?
- inner join when implicit joins in :where
- per ds/dm hooks - after-query, before-save
- rel reversal fn
- derived fields - fn of one or more other paths
- have expand-query return all final paths, so it matches query results?
- move hooks into data source?
- auto-add two-hop reverse rels? e.g., film -> actor
- lein-cantata plugin; auto gen model from db
- batched query; leverage limit/offset
- field aliasing? doc support or lack thereof
- :readonly entity key?
- traverse into SqlCalls to qualify fields
	- how to distinguish fields from other args for special fns?
- fn handlers (some are engine specific)
	- "interval 30 day" etc
	- cast
	- datediff
	- datepart
	- convert
- cross-source joins
- allow exports with cyclic deps
	- issue warning, then choose arbitrary ordering?
- support joins in delete and update
- exception for [< :foo :bar] - i.e., using < instead of :<
- verily validations?
- handle certain DB data types better
	- mysql set/enum, psql enum -- can't represent as keywords; special enum wrapper type?
- data source protocols? pure clojure data source??
- :deferred field attr, for blobs and such - i.e., exclude from :*
- prepared statements??
- source/schema-level options
	- no implicit joins 
- be a bit smarter about using save! vs update/insert! when saving rels
