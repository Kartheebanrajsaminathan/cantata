- more concise printable representation for data model / prepared query?
- playground: logging, query cache
- test playground with latest version
- traverse into SqlCalls to qualify fields
- bug: can't combine :with and :include when one is a subpath of the other
	- have to handle each sucessive shortest path, regardless of clause?
- prismatic's schema to validate records and other bits
- consider lazy fetching strategy
	- disinclined to provide it as an option - implicit n+1 nastiness
- user guide
	- rel loading: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/loading.html
- subquery rel loading strategy?
- allow data source to be a function
- java logging
	- trace logging
- tests for recursive rels
- allow saving has-one rels?
- export/import :bytes data
	- #base64 reader tag (should add namespace?)
	- wrap in container type, define print-method for that
	- crib from https://github.com/hiredman/bytes/blob/master/src/com/thelastcitadel/bytes.clj
	- can use staff picture from original sakila data to test
- custom :on rel clause
- optimization: inner join when implicit joins in :where and nil not used
- postgres array support
	- reify java.sql.Array?
	- see http://tech.valgog.com/2009/02/passing-arrays-to-postgresql-database.html
- derived fields - fn of one or more other paths
- :deferred field attr, for blobs and such - i.e., exclude from :*
- prepared statements??
- source/schema-level options
	- no implicit joins 
- be a bit smarter about using save! vs update/insert! when saving rels
- dsl for rels?
	- belongs-to, has-one, has-many
- subquery in :from? https://gist.github.com/3984333
- allow ad-hoc entities in join, include, etc
	- must add them to qenv
- marshal values in :where according to field types
	- pair up values with fields? impossible to do generically? good enough?
- rel reversal fn
- have expand-query return all final paths, so it matches query results?
- move hooks into data source?
- auto-add two-hop reverse rels? e.g., film -> actor
- lein-cantata plugin
	- auto gen & output model from db
	- generate graph image with rhizome
- batched query; leverage limit/offset
- field aliasing? doc support or lack thereof
- :readonly entity key?
- fn handlers (some are engine specific)
	- "interval 30 day" etc
	- cast
	- datediff
	- datepart
	- convert
- cross-source joins
- allow exports with cyclic deps
	- issue warning, then choose arbitrary ordering?
- support joins in delete and update
- exception for [< :foo :bar] - i.e., using < instead of :<
- verily validations?
- handle certain DB data types better
	- mysql set/enum, psql enum -- can't represent as keywords; special enum wrapper type?
- move manip fns to own ns
- data source protocols? pure clojure data source??
- see htsql for possible future extensions: http://htsql.org/doc/overview.html#in-sql-modest-complexity-is-painful
- multiple data source types?
	- jdbc, pure clojure, datomic(??)
